## What is Quarto?

"Quarto is a multi-language, next generation version of R Markdown from Posit, with many new new features and capabilities. Like R Markdown, Quarto uses knitr to execute R code, and is therefore able to render most existing Rmd files [without modification](https://quarto.org/)."

## Why Quarto?

-   Seamless integration 
-   Ease of use
-   More intuitive than using R Markdown or even R scripts.
-   Potential of creating dashboards to illustrate statistical analysis undertaken

## Use Cases for Grattan

Version control, reproducibility in code, sharing work efficiently with your team and passing work on to others.

* Seamless integration in being able to create [blogs](https://grattan.github.io/school-ed-2025-primary-maths/).
* PISA analysis: QC, VC, adaptability. 
* [Grattan R Guide](https://grattan.github.io/R_at_Grattan/). Instead of requiring bookdown here, we could directly use Quarto.

## Setting Up Quarto

To get started with Quarto, you will need to **install Quarto**. You can do this by [here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

Once you have installed the Quarto, you can create a new Quarto document by:

1.  Go to the File menu in RStudio

2.  Select New `File` \> `New File` \> `Quarto Document`

![](images/select_new.png){width="307" fig-align="center"}

3.  Choose the document type: `Document`, `Presentation`, or `Interactive`.

![](images/document_type.png){width="347" fig-align="center"}

::: callout-note
A Quarto file is a plain text file with the extension `.qmd`.

### Multi-language Support

The principal languages supported by Quarto are Python, R, Julia, and Observable JavaScript. 

```{python}

import pandas as pd

# creating a dataframe
population_data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'],
    'Age': [24, 27, 22, 32],
    'City': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago', 'Houston']
}

df = pd.DataFrame(population_data)
print("DataFrame:\n", df)

# Calculate the mean age
mean_age = df['Age'].mean()
print("\nMean Age:", mean_age)

```


#### Chunk Options

```{r}
#| label: fig-mtcars
#| echo: fenced
#| fig-cap: "A plot of the mtcars dataset"
#| fig-subcap:
#|  - "Relationship between mpg and wt"

library(ggplot2)

mtcars |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) +
  geom_point()

```

Referencing plots made is easy, you can use @fig-mtcars to reference the plot above.

### Annotating Code

```{r}
#| label: penguin-analysis
#| eval: false
library(palmerpenguins) # <1>
library(dplyr)          # <1>
penguins |>             # <2>
  select(flipper_length_mm) |> # <3>
  arrange()             # <4>
                  

```

1.  Load the `palmerpenguins` and `dplyr` libraries.
2.  Choose the data you'd like to work with.
3.  Choosing the variable I'd like to explore
4.  Arrange in ascending order the variable by `flipper_length_mm`.

```{r}
#| label: test-code-annotation
#| eval: false
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins |>                                      # <1>
  mutate(                                        # <2>
    bill_ratio = bill_depth_mm / bill_length_mm, # <3>
    bill_area  = bill_depth_mm * bill_length_mm  # <3>
  )                                              # <2>
```

1.  Take `penguins`, and then,
2.  Add new columns for the `bill_ratio` and `bill_area`.
3.  Calculate the ratio of `bill_depth_mm` to `bill_length_mm` and the area of the bill.

## Creating Captivating Stand Alone Documents

### Callouts

-   Using callouts to highlight important information and break up text

::: callout-note
Note that there are five types of callouts, including: `note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.
:::

::: callout-tip
## Tip with Title

This is an example of a callout with a title.
:::

::: callout-warning
This is a warning callout
:::

::: callout-important
This is a important callout
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Collapse Call Outs

Allows you to add more information that is valuable, but may not need to be taking space in the document. `collapse="false"` will show the content by default.
:::

### Interactive ways to break up documents

::: {.panel-tabset group="Perspectives"}
## Sweave
**Sweave** was one of the first tools for literate programming in R, allowing users to embed R code in LaTeX documents.


## R Markdown

**R Markdown** is a modern alternative to Sweave, integrating text and R code to produce different outputs such as HTML, PDF, and Word, not *just LaTeX.*
:::




### Commenting and Highlighting

Another fun thing about Quarto is the ability to add comments to your document. This can be done using the `comments` option in the YAML front matter. 

You can also turn comments off on specific pages by using the `comments: false` option in the YAML of that specific page!

To use the commenting and highlighting feature used in this qmd, you will need to register for an account with [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/). 

::: callout-tip
`hypothes.is` is one of the commenting features you can use, for more view [here](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/projects/websites.html#utterances).
:::

This feature can be used on [published](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/) and private Quarto documents.

### Formatting Images

::: {layout="[[1,1], [1]]"}
![Cat](images/cat1.png){height=400}

![Cat](images/cat2.png){height=400}

![Not a cat](images/cat3.png){width=800}
:::

For more [layout options](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html#complex-layouts).


::: callout-note
# Hover Option
Hover option for cross-referencing makes it easier for readers to quickly glance at the figure at later points in the report, i.e. @fig-mtcars.
