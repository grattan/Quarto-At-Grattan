## What is Quarto?

"Quarto is a multi-language, next generation version of R Markdown from Posit, with many new new features and capabilities. Like R Markdown, Quarto uses knitr to execute R code, and is therefore able to render most existing Rmd files [without modification](https://quarto.org/)."

## Why Quarto?

-   Seamless integration
-   Ease of use
-   More intuitive
-   Potential of creating dashboards to illustrate statistical analysis undertaken

### Multi-language Support

```{python}

import pandas as pd

# creating a dataframe
population_data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'],
    'Age': [24, 27, 22, 32],
    'City': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago', 'Houston']
}

df = pd.DataFrame(population_data)
print("DataFrame:\n", df)

# Calculate the mean age
mean_age = df['Age'].mean()
print("\nMean Age:", mean_age)

```


#### Chunk Options

```{r}
#| label: fig-mtcars
#| echo: fenced
#| fig-cap: "A plot of the mtcars dataset"

library(ggplot2)

mtcars |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) +
  geom_point()

```

Referencing plots made is easy, you can use @fig-mtcars to reference the plot above.

### Annotating Code

```{r}
#| label: penguin-analysis
#| eval: false
library(palmerpenguins) # <1>
library(dplyr)          # <1>
penguins |>             # <2>
  select(flipper_length_mm) |> # <3>
  arrange()             # <4>
                  

```

1.  Load the `palmerpenguins` and `dplyr` libraries.
2.  Choose the data you'd like to work with.
3.  Choosing the variable I'd like to explore
4.  Arrange in ascending order the variable by `flipper_length_mm`.

```{r}
#| label: test-code-annotation
#| eval: false
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins |>                                      # <1>
  mutate(                                        # <2>
    bill_ratio = bill_depth_mm / bill_length_mm, # <3>
    bill_area  = bill_depth_mm * bill_length_mm  # <3>
  )                                              # <2>
```

1.  Take `penguins`, and then,
2.  Add new columns for the `bill_ratio` and `bill_area`.
3.  Calculate the ratio of `bill_depth_mm` to `bill_length_mm` and the area of the bill.

## Creating Captivating Stand Alone Documents

### Callouts

-   Using callouts to highlight important information and break up text

::: callout-note
Note that there are five types of callouts, including: `note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.
:::

::: callout-tip
## Tip with Title

This is an example of a callout with a title.
:::

::: callout-warning
This is a warning callout
:::

::: callout-important
This is a important callout
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Collapse Call Outs

Allows you to add more information that is valuable, but may not need to be taking space in the document. `collapse="false"` will show the content by default.
:::

### Commenting and Highlighting

Another fun thing about Quarto is the ability to add comments to your document. This can be done using the `comments` option in the YAML front matter. 

You can also turn comments off on specific pages by using the `comments: false` option in the YAML of that specific page!

To use the commenting and highlighting feature used in this qmd, you will need to register for an account with [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/).

### Formatting Images

::: {layout="[[1,1], [1]]"}
![Cat](images/cat1.png){height=400}

![Cat](images/cat2.png){height=400}

![Not a cat](images/cat3.png){width=800}
